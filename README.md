## Project Overview
A Java console application that displays current times across different countries. Users can check local times, view dates with year included, and compare time differences between countries.

## Development Experience
This project involved significant technical challenges from the beginning. The initial console application development faced multiple technical issues that required starting from scratch multiple times. Additionally, attempting to implement a JavaFX GUI version with Scene Builder I faced problems where it was not compatible in many places and also problems with Java module configurations in newer JDK versions. Due to these persistent technical hurdles, regular Git commits at each step were not possible, and the final working version was created from scratch to ensure submission is done on time in a short span.

## How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites:
- Java JDK 8 or higher
- IntelliJ IDEA (or any Java IDE)

### Running in IntelliJ:
1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
2. Navigate to: src/Main.java
3. Click the green play button or right-click -> Run 'Main.main()'
4. Follow the console prompts

### Running from Command Line:
cd src
javac Main.java
java Main


## Features
- Time Display: Shows current time for 10+ countries covering all continents
- Date with Year: All dates include the year (e.g, March 17, 2025)
- AM/PM Format: Times shown in 12-hour format with AM/PM
- Time Comparison: Compare time differences between any two countries
- Simple Interface: Easy-to-use console menu

## Implementedd Java topics
* Variables, data types, and operators for data manipulation
* Control flow statements (if-else) for decision-making logic
* Loops (for, while) 
* simple Arrays for storing and accessing country and timezone information
* Classes and objects including Scanner for input and java.time classes for date/time operations
* File Input output concept demonstrated through the countries.txt data structure

- SceneBuilder layouting
- Controller was tried (UI/UX)
